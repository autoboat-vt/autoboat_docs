# <p style="text-align: center;"> Standards and Definitions</p>

### Definitions:

- Autopilot Mode: Autopilot mode typically refers to whether or not the autopilot is in RC control, a semi-autonomous mode like hold heading, or in a full autonomous mode. This is just a string that describes the autopilot mode for the telemetry.
   
- Full Autonomy Maneuver: The full autonomy maneuver is only really used for the sailboat in a fully autonomous mode. This describes whether the boat is currently tacking clockwise, tacking counterclockwise, or is normally sailing and navigating towards a specific heading.


### Wind Angle/ Vector Standards
# TODO

- Global True Wind Angle:
- True Wind Angle:
- Apparent Wind Angle:




TODO: autopilot mode vs full autonomy maneuver, apparent wind angle vs true wind angle vs global true wind angle and their corresponding vectors
