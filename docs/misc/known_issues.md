# Known Issues:

- In order to get full intellisense, you need to restart the dev container after building it. Idk how to fix this man but just go with it. The issue might be that the docker dev environment doesn't register the .vscode folder when it first starts up which is interesting... not sure how I would go about fixing it if thats the issue.
