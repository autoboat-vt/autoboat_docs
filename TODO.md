# **FINISH TELEMETRY SERVER DOCUMENTATION and Groundstation documentation**

# **MAKE DOCUMENTATION ON THE UDEV RULES**

# **ADD SYSTEMCTL DOCUMENTATION**

# **ADD WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION**

# **ADD DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO USE THE CAMERA NODE**

# **ADD DOCUMENTATION THAT EXPLAINS WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DO WITH DOCKER, ROS, ETC**

in every case where there is a note only relevant to macOS users, add an apple logo to ensure its totally clear to someone glancing over the documentation that you should only do those things if you own a mac.
