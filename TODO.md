# **FINISH TELEMETRY SERVER DOCUMENTATION and Groundstation documentation**

# **MAKE DOCUMENTATION ON THE UDEV RULES**

# **ADD SYSTEMCTL DOCUMENTATION**

# **ADD WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION**


**TODO MAYBE ADD A VISUAL EXAMPLE OF THE GLOBAL TRUE WIND VECTOR TO MAKE IT MAKE SENSE**

in every case where there is a note only relevant to macOS users, add an apple logo to ensure its totally clear to someone glancing over the documentation that you should only do those things if you own a mac.
