# **FINISH TELEMETRY SERVER DOCUMENTATION and Groundstation documentation**

# **MAKE DOCUMENTATION ON THE UDEV RULES**

# **ADD SYSTEMCTL DOCUMENTATION**

# **ADD WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION**

# **ADD DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO USE THE CAMERA NODE**

# **ADD DOCUMENTATION THAT EXPLAINS WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DO WITH DOCKER, ROS, ETC**
for example explain for docker that you should understand what containers, images, and devcontainers are. You should understand how to build an image, run an image (create a container), and how to push images to docker hub. You should also be familiar with simple build commands in a Dockerfile

# **TODO ADD A MENTION OF THE STUFF IN THE ISSUES.TXT IN THE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**


**TODO MAYBE ADD A VISUAL EXAMPLE OF THE GLOBAL TRUE WIND VECTOR TO MAKE IT MAKE SENSE**

maybe rename local velocity to something else

in every case where there is a note only relevant to macOS users, add an apple logo to ensure its totally clear to someone glancing over the documentation that you should only do those things if you own a mac.


add a checklist before commiting anything that says: "have you changed a node, check if anything in that node's documentation has changed, have you changed something with how the system as a whole functions, change the system diagrams, etc etc" this will help people update the documentation before they commit hopefully
